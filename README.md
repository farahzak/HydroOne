Overview

This project demonstrates a comprehensive risk management analysis inspired by Hydro One’s enterprise strategies. The project includes data analysis, risk prioritization, and mitigation strategy design using Python. It provides visual insights through graphs that help identify high-impact risks, optimize resource allocation, and plan mitigation strategies effectively. All graphs were generated using ChatGPT’s integrated Python capabilities.

Project Objectives

Analyze Risk Data: Categorize and prioritize risks using real-world metrics like risk score, financial impact, and timeline impact.

Visualize Key Insights: Create impactful visualizations to highlight critical areas.

Design Mitigation Strategies: Develop strategies for high-priority risks (e.g., Supply Chain and Technological risks).

Enable Stakeholder Communication: Provide actionable insights through a structured report and visuals.

Demonstrate Evidence-Based Practices: Reference Hydro One's published reports and case studies to highlight how these solutions and insights align with their proven methodologies.

Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python

Libraries:

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

Matplotlib: For creating static visualizations.

NumPy: For numerical calculations.

Graph Visualizations

The following graphs were generated to support data-driven decision-making:

1. Risk Category Breakdown

Description: Bar chart showing the frequency of risks across categories (e.g., Operational, Supply Chain).

Insight: Highlights the categories contributing most to project risks.

Evidence: Hydro One has historically prioritized Operational and Supply Chain risks in its Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework. (Hydro One ERM Framework, 2023)

File: graphs/risk_category_breakdown.png



2. Pareto Chart

Description: Pareto chart of cumulative risk contributions by category.

Insight: Identifies the 20% of categories contributing to 80% of risks.

Evidence: Hydro One’s use of Pareto analysis for asset investment planning aligns with this visualization. (Hydro One Case Study on Risk-Based Asset Investment Planning, 2017)

File: graphs/pareto_chart.png



3. Risk Score vs. Financial Impact

Description: Scatter plot of risk scores vs. potential financial impact.

Insight: Pinpoints high-risk, high-cost issues for prioritization.

Evidence: Hydro One evaluates financial impacts alongside risk scores to prioritize mitigation efforts. (Hydro One ERM Framework, 2023)

File: graphs/risk_vs_financial_impact.png



4. Timeline Impact vs. Risk Score

Description: Line chart showing the correlation between timeline delays and risk scores.

Insight: Highlights risks causing significant delays.

Evidence: Hydro One’s risk timeline analysis includes evaluating delays caused by supply chain disruptions and regulatory factors. (Hydro One Corporate Report, 2023)

File: graphs/timeline_vs_risk_score.png



5. Mitigation Cost vs. Risk Score

Description: Bubble chart of mitigation costs vs. risk scores.

Insight: Helps identify cost-effective mitigation strategies.

Evidence: Hydro One regularly evaluates cost-to-impact ratios in their contingency planning process. (Hydro One ERM Framework, 2023)

File: graphs/mitigation_cost_vs_risk_score.png



6. Adjusted Risk Score vs. Timeline Impact

Description: Scatter plot of adjusted risk scores vs. timeline impacts.

Insight: Highlights how adjusted risks affect project schedules.

Evidence: Hydro One’s compound risk score evaluations include assessing adjusted scores to monitor project timelines effectively. (Hydro One ERM Framework, 2023)

How to Run the Project

Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/hydro-one-risk-project.git
cd hydro-one-risk-project

Install Dependencies:
Ensure you have Python installed. Run:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the Analysis:
Navigate to the notebooks/ folder and open data_analysis.ipynb to execute the analysis and generate graphs.

Generate Graphs:
Alternatively, run the script to create all graphs:

python scripts/generate_graphs.py

Insights and Applications

Key Insights:

Supply Chain and Technological Risks: The highest contributors to project delays and financial impacts.

Mitigation Strategies: High-cost risks demand proactive strategies, such as diversifying suppliers and phased technological upgrades.

Stakeholder Communication: High PR and stakeholder impact risks require targeted messaging to maintain trust.

Applications:

Stakeholder Reports: Use visualizations and insights for effective communication.

Risk Dashboards: Integrate graphs into dynamic dashboards for real-time monitoring.

Scenario Simulations: Adapt the dataset to simulate various risk scenarios.

Future Work

Expand the dataset to include more granular risk factors.

Incorporate interactive dashboards using Tableau or Power BI.

Automate report generation for real-time updates.
