# Hydro One Risk Management Project

## **Overview**
This project demonstrates a comprehensive risk management analysis inspired by Hydro One’s enterprise strategies. The project includes data analysis, risk prioritization, and mitigation strategy design using Python. It provides visual insights through graphs that help identify high-impact risks, optimize resource allocation, and plan mitigation strategies effectively. All graphs were generated using Python's visualization libraries.

## **Project Objectives**
1. **Analyze Risk Data**: Categorize and prioritize risks using real-world metrics like risk score, financial impact, and timeline impact.
2. **Visualize Key Insights**: Create impactful visualizations to highlight critical areas.
3. **Design Mitigation Strategies**: Develop strategies for high-priority risks (e.g., Supply Chain and Technological risks).
4. **Enable Stakeholder Communication**: Provide actionable insights through a structured report and visuals.
5. **Demonstrate Evidence-Based Practices**: Reference Hydro One's published reports and case studies to highlight how these solutions and insights align with their proven methodologies.
